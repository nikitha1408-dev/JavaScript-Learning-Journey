# JavaScript-Learning-Journey
My structured JavaScript learning journey — starting from DOM fundamentals and progressing to asynchronous programming and real-world mini applications.

# Cat Switch (DOM Practice)

This is my first DOM manipulation exercise.

The goal of this task was to understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements using event listeners and dynamically updates UI based on user actions.

## Concepts Practiced
- querySelector
- click events
- changing attributes
- updating images dynamically

This is part of my JavaScript learning journey.
